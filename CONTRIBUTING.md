# Contribute to Reload project

Feedback and pull requests are very welcome!

## Ask for help, feature or report a bug

Feel free to create feature request and bug report in the [issues](https://github.com/smeup/reload/issues).
Only make sure that your request/report is not the duplicate of an exiting issue.

## Choose an issue to work on

Issues marked [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/smeup/reload/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22) 
or [good first issue](https://github.com/smeup/reload/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 
are supposed to be easy and isolated enough to be done by anyone having interest in contributing.
